Developed a full-stack Java-based web application to streamline band and committee management processes, integrating secure user authentication, data modeling, and dynamic services. This project demonstrates advanced backend development and software engineering skills. Key highlights include:

Features and Functionality:
User Management:

Role-based access control with distinct roles for admins, directors, and members.
Secure authentication and authorization using custom Spring Security configurations.
Committee and Membership:

Manage member details, child memberships, and participation tracking.
Features include registration, login, and account updates via RESTful APIs.
Instrument and Item Loans:

Loan tracking for instruments and miscellaneous items with support for loan requests and approvals.
Repository and service layers ensure seamless CRUD operations on loan entities.
Event Management:

Dashboard for managing performances, participation requests, and committee events.
Integration with performance music and participation details.
Orders and Inventory:

Handles order processing for music and miscellaneous items, with inventory control.
Allows tracking and management of orders through dedicated APIs.
Technical Implementation:
Backend:

Built with Spring Boot, leveraging the MVC architecture for modularity and scalability.
